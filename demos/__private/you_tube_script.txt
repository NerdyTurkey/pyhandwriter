b. in meantime have made a pyhandwriter module (github link in desription)
c. some feature have changed since intro video
d. flag 2 more videos, inclduding this one


Spyder
======
1. New file

2. ALT + 1 --> demo1.py --> run
my font chooser - choose "gigi"
Notes:
i. lots of pygame built in fonts; this helps choose them
ii. here, this is helpful to choose font to trace to make your own handwritten version
iii. returns a lits of selected fonts
iv. I'm looking for a cursive type font to trace; gigi looks nice

3. New file

4. ALT + 2 --> demo2.py --> run
using Recorder to trace "gigi" (trace box, save)
plus symbols heart, music, alpha, beta (use trace no box, save as)
Notes:
i. we use the recorder method to record our handwriting
ii. I'll tell it that I want to trace the "gigi" built-in font, and save as "my_gigi"
iii. Now, recorder will go through the character set for gigi and I can trace each in turn
iv. if I don't like my attempt, I can try as many times as I want
v. [go through entire char set - speed up video later]
vi. Can also record any special characters, using save as; these won't be part of this handwritten font. I'll show later how to handwrite these.

5. New file
ALT + 3 --> demo3.py --> run
handwriting gigi + symbols
Notes:
i. Now we'll use the write_text() method to try out our new recorded font.
ii. As we saw in a previous video (embed link in video!), there are lots of escape characters we can embed for new lines, tabs etc etc
iii. The symbols we recorded are included between backticks, like in markdown, if you're familiar with this.

Then manually
6 cursor="quill_light" --> run
Notes:
i. To show a few more features, we'll change the cursor from the default pencil to a quill, for that olde worlde touch.

7. nib={"width":8, "angle":45} --> run
Notes:
i. The thin, unchanging line doesn't look right for a quill, so we can change the nib, using the nib keyword. We use a dictionary to set the width and angle of the nib. I think a width of 8 and angle of 45 degrees looks pretty good.

8. Delete lines
hw = ....
..
hw.write_text(..)
Notes:
i. A feature I quite like, is a spray can cursor. So let's delete this bit of text...

9. At start of deleted region, ALT + 4 --> demo4.py
spraycan demo
Notes:
i. This looks better at a larger font size. I'm going to use a bright colour to make it look like graffiti.


10. Open recorder.py and do code review
