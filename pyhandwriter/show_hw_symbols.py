    Displays all available hw symbols in alphabetical order on screen in

    Depending on 'screen' size and 'text_size', if there are too many symbols
    to show on one page, they will be displayed over several screens. You can
    mmove through these with the arrow keys.

    The symbols name is displayed in the window caption when the mouse cursor

    them. The names of the selected symbols are returned as a list when the
    user quits. The list is in selection order.
